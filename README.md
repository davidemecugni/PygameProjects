# PygameProjects 

## A star
The projects include a visual rappresentation of the A star algorithm implementing a grid setup where is possible to place obstacles and follow step by step the decision making that the algo utilises. It's also possible to modify the euristic of the algo and spot the differences.

## Conway's Game of Life
Simple implementation of game of life with a toggle "Pac-Man" effect(the slider will appear on the opposite side of the window)
