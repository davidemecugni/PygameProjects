# PygameProjects 

## A star
The project is a visual representation of the A star algorithm implementing a grid setup where is possible to place obstacles and follow step by step the decision-making that the algo utilizes. It's also possible to modify the heuristics implemented and spot the differences.

## Conway's Game of Life
Simple implementation of the game of life with a toggle "Pac-Man" effect(the slider will appear on the opposite side of the window)
